It all began with a unique childhood.

I grew up in an unusual environment; my grandpa used to run a petrol kiosk and my entire life
revolved around it. It was great. We had a large backyard all to ourselves, 3 large dogs to chase
around everyday and when we're free, we can just take some tidbits and snack on them.
An awesome childhood indeed.

On the serious side of things though, I always helped out in our day-to-day business operations;
helping to pump petrol, mending the cashier counter, counting money at the end of the day etc. And
I guess they marks my first few jobs.

Yet, memories soon became memories when the franchise eventually took up a central management model.
And that marked the end of the memorable parts with many lasting impressions; the witnessing of a
burgler placing a 6-inches long parang against my mum's neck, the daily hustle and bustle of regular
business operations, and many more.

Fast forward many years, I always wondered how my grandfather landed his journey into the business.
Great man he was, running a single business that sustained an entire family's livelihood. Perhaps
it was not at the level of enterprises, but it was still no mean feat - figuring things out during
and after the times of war and all.

Running a business meant a lot to me then. It means a lot to me now. It indicates one's abilities to
navigate the intricacies of the society, finding a place in it and making it yours. It indicates a
full miriad of skills that's not bounded to a certain context, the identifying and grasping of
opportunities, the weighing of opportunity costs, and the making of decisions that were fraught with
uncertainty. Then making it work.

Finally here I am now, clueless as ever trying to figure life out. It began with a thought of
talking to more people to learn from them. Jotting down these simple conversations, stringing them
into a series of stories of their experiences and learnings, I eventually decided to follow the
crowd's wisdom and start a blog to log them all down. All these while, finding great pleasure in the
process.

And so it begins.
